# Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Heart-Failure-Mortality
Analyzed a Kaggle dataset of 299 heart failure/injury patients:
•	Investigated and visualized, by tidyverse and ggplot2 packages, the relationship between these variables and the mortality rate to obtain insights about the potential risks
•	Implemented logistic regression to develop a prediction model for mortality rate using creatinine phosphokinase level and ejection fraction
